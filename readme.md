👋 Hi there! I'm Barathi Sridhar, a highly motivated and skilled full-stack developer with experience in designing and developing web applications 🌐, building data pipelines 🚀, and implementing machine learning models 🤖. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and delivering innovative solutions to clients 💡.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I earned my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from SASTRA University in India in May 2020.

💻 I have strong skills in JavaScript, Angular, Reactjs, Python, Java, SQL, and database management. I'm proficient in a range of tools and technologies, including Git, Bash, Linux, NumPy, Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, Matplotlib, and more.

💼 In my previous role as a Systems Engineer (Data Engineer) at Infosys Private Limited in Chennai, India, I worked with clients to construct and monitor data pipelines with multiple stages and complex transformations, devising reports and dashboards using industry tools like SSRS and PowerBI. I also automated the SSIS package monitoring system and resolved client issues with 0% SLA breach.

In my role at LeadHawk LLC, I engineered a React frontend with Material-UI and Redux, implemented MongoDB with Spring Data, and designed webhooks for seamless Stripe API integration. I also built a robust Spring Boot backend for up to 1,000 users and set up a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions for Docker images deployed on AWS Fargate. Exciting challenges, but always ready for more! 🚀😊
